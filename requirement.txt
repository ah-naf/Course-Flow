i am creating a web app in which authenticated user can upload, edit and do other important operation on a document using rest api and websocket. 
i have done creating user and auth route. now i want to start with working the document route. 
What should it contains? omit the websocket part for now. only do that can be done using the rest api. 



Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step breakdown into tasks and sub‐tasks for building your Collaborative Document Editor. This plan covers everything—from project setup to deployment—and includes real-time collaboration via WebSocket, file uploading/serving, authentication, caching, background job processing, and more.

---

# **Project: Collaborative Document Editor**

> **Overview:**  
> Build a web application where multiple users can collaborate on editing documents in real time. Users can also upload files (e.g., images or attachments) that get stored locally, while the backend (in Go) exposes REST endpoints, manages WebSocket connections for live collaboration, integrates with PostgreSQL for persistent storage, uses Redis for caching, and processes background jobs via a queue. The React frontend will handle user authentication, editing (with a rich text editor), file uploads, and real-time updates.

---

## **Task 1: Project Setup & Environment Configuration**

### **Sub-task 1.1: Backend (Go) Setup**
- **Initialize Module & Repository:**
  - Create a new Git repository.
  - Run `go mod init github.com/yourusername/collab-doc-editor`.
- **Establish Folder Structure:**
  - Create folders such as:
    - `/cmd` — for the main application entry point.
    - `/internal/api` — for HTTP handlers and routes.
    - `/internal/models` — for data models (User, Document, File, etc.).
    - `/internal/auth` — for authentication (JWT, middleware, etc.).
    - `/internal/ws` — for WebSocket server logic.
    - `/internal/queue` — for job queue and worker implementation.
    - `/pkg` — for shared utilities and helper functions.
- **Set Up Basic HTTP Server:**
  - Choose between `net/http` or a router framework (like Gorilla Mux or Gin).
  - Create a basic server that logs requests and listens on a configurable port.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Plan for configuration (database URLs, Redis settings, JWT secret, file storage paths, etc.).
  - Create a sample `.env` file.

### **Sub-task 1.2: Frontend (React) Setup**
- **Project Bootstrapping:**
  - Use Create React App (or your preferred boilerplate) to initialize your React project.

  - Create directories for:
    - `/src/components` — for UI components.
    - `/src/services` — for API and WebSocket service code.
    - `/src/context` or `/src/store` — for state management (using React Context API or Redux).
- **Dependency Installation:**
  - Install libraries for a rich text editor (e.g., Draft.js or Quill).
  - Install packages for HTTP requests (e.g., Axios) and WebSocket management.
- **Basic App Shell:**
  - Build a simple landing page and router setup (using React Router) to navigate between login, document list, and editor pages.

### **Sub-task 1.3: Docker & Docker Compose Setup**
- **Dockerfiles:**
  - Create a `Dockerfile` for the Go backend.
  - Create a `Dockerfile` for the React frontend.

    - The Go API server.
    - The React frontend.
    - PostgreSQL (for database).
    - Redis (for caching and possibly for queue management).

# **Final Remarks**

This breakdown divides your project into granular, actionable sub-tasks. Starting with project setup and progressing through database design, authentication, REST API endpoints, file handling, real-time collaboration via WebSocket, context management, caching, and frontend development ensures that nothing is left behind. You can tackle each sub-task sequentially or in parallel (if working in a team) to build a robust, full-featured collaborative document editor that leverages all the key concepts in Go and React.

Happy coding!
